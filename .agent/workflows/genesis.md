# 🌌 /genesis: The ARKITETV-1 Protocol

This workflow initializes the **Omniscient Architect** state. Use this to transform a standard request into a high-performance mission.

## Step 1: Initial Singularity (Research & Memory)

1. Execute `cat ~/.cortex/context-snapshot.md` to load cross-project memory.
2. Use `ls -R` to map the current territory.
3. Identify all active "Ghosts" and consolidate them.

## Step 2: The Blueprint (Design & Strategy)

1. Read `/antigravity` and current skills to verify tool availability.
2. Create `implementation_plan.md` with "Awards-Edition" as the baseline.
3. **Requirement**: Every plan MUST include a dedicated GSAP/Lenis/Motion section for aesthetics.

## Step 3: Swarm Activation

1. Invoke the `/400-subagents` God Mode to distribute tasks.
2. Create specialized sub-tasks in `task.md` following the MEJORAlo v7.3 standard.

## Step 4: Visual Sovereignty

1. If UI is involved, call the `Stitch Designer` skill.
2. Enforce the "Moskv Aesthetic" (Deep Blacks, Gold Accents, Industrial Noir).

## Step 3: The Ouroboros (Hardening)

1. Run `npm run build` or equivalent after every major block.
2. Execute `/qa` protocol with browser subagents.
3. Commit result to Cortex Memory.
